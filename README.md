- After that's built, As you can see below it is detected by Windows Defender as a severe malware. Which is expected since it IS malware.

![pd2](https://github.com/quantumcored/paradoxiaRAT/raw/master/images/pd2.PNG)

- I'm going to transfer the client on a Windows 10 Virtual machine and execute it. After Executing it, It appears under Startup programs in task manager.

- Also it has copied itself inside Appdata directory and installed under the name we specified during build.

- At the same time, I get a session at server side.

![pd4](https://github.com/quantumcored/paradoxiaRAT/raw/master/images/pd4.PNG)

- First thing I'd do is get in the session and view information.

- There are plenty of things we can do right now, but for example only, I will demonstrate keylogging.

![pd6](https://github.com/quantumcored/paradoxiaRAT/raw/master/images/pd7.PNG)

You can see in the image above that It says it successfully injected dll, And in file listing there is a file named ``log.log``, Which contains the logged keystrokes.

- Lets view captures keystrokes.
